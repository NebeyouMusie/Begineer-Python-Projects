7. **Dice Roll Simulator**
   - The Dice Roll Simulation can be done by choosing a random integer between 1         and 6 for which we can use the random module in the Python programming             language.
8. **QR Codes**
   - QR is short for Quick Response, and they are named so because they can be          read quickly by a cell phone. They are used to take information from               transitory media and put it on your cell phone.
 9. **Quiz Game**
     - Simple quiz game using python.
 10. **Print Colored Text**
